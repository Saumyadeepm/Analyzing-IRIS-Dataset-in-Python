# *Playing with IRIS Dataset*
**Objective**
<br> *To be able to analyze huge data using Pandas in Python*
<br>***Problem Definition***
<br>
<br>*Using the Pandas Library, along with Basic Programming Commands for <br>performing the Following Tasks:*
<br>
<br>*৹ Import the Toy IRIS Dataset* 
<br>
<br>*৹ Print the Head and Tail of the Dataset (first 5 and last 5 entries)*
<br>
<br>*৹ Create a New Column named "Average" and find the Average of existing <br>four features and store the same*
<br>
<br>*৹ Create a New Column named "Sum" and find the Sum of existing four <br>features and store the same*
<br>
<br>*৹ Check how many entires of "IRIS Setosa", "IRIS Virgnica" and "IRIS <br>Versicolor" are present in the Dataset*
<br>
<br>*৹ Find the Descriptive Statistics about all the Six Columns (existing <br>four + two made-up features)*
<br>
<br>*৹ Find the entries whose Sum Values are more than a User Input*
<br>
<br>*৹ Find the entries whose Sepal_Length is greater than Petal_Width*
<br>
<br>
**Approach/ Methods**
<br> *By Using Sklearn, Pandas, Numpy & Display module to display the <br>dataframe in Dataframe format*
**Observations**
<br> *Used sklearn library to load the iris dataset rather than manually <br>uploading & reading it
<br>
<br> Used Display module to easliy display the dataframe in Well <br>formatted way
<br>
<br> Used Head & Tail function to fetch the Dataset rather than manually <br>fetching it
<br>
<br> Used loc function to fetch the values for the calculation of <br>average & sum of the values
<br>
<br> Used count function to fetch the values of species
<br>
<br> Used describe function to get the descriptive statistics of all the <br>columns
<br>*
**Results**
<br>*• Data Representation
<br>• Less Writing of Code
<br>• Efficiently handles huge data
<br>• Makes the data more customizable & flexible
<br>• Considered as one of the useful library for analyzing data*
**Learning & Reflection**
<br>*Learned about how to efficiently & effectively handle huge data.
<br>
<br>About how to make it more representable by utilizing existing <br>function available to us.
<br>
<br>About how to write less code and still get the work done <br>efficiently.*
